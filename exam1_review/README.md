# Combined In-Class Code Examples

This folder contains the **combined and improved** versions of code examples from both `exam1_review_1` and `exam1_review_2` sessions.

## Python Files

### Array/List Operations
- **`lookup_array.py`** - Direct lookup using index as ID, parallel lists
- **`searching_array.py`** - Linear search with flag, finding index with range()
- **`searching_array_with_in.py`** - Using the `in` operator for lists and strings

### File Operations
- **`file_read.py`** - Three ways to read files: read(), readlines(), for line in file
- **`file_write.py`** - Writing files with "w" mode (overwrite) and "a" mode (append)

### String and File Parsing
- **`string_parsing.py`** - Parsing structured strings with split()
- **`file_parsing.py`** - Reading and parsing log files (verbose and compact versions)
- **`log_parsing_using_ids.py`** - Parsing logs with numeric IDs for O(1) lookup

### Dynamic Strings
- **`dynamic_string_generation.py`** - Using f-strings for dynamic file names and messages

## Data Files

- **`combatlog.txt`** - Combat events in format: attacker:name,defender:name,damage:value
- **`combatlog_idsonly.txt`** - Combat events using IDs: attacker_id defender_id damage
- **`pokemonid_0.txt`** through **`pokemonid_3.txt`** - Pokemon data files for dynamic file reading

## Key Improvements

All files include:
- Clear explanatory comments
- Multiple examples showing different approaches
- Teaching notes about when to use each method
- Step-by-step explanations for complex operations
- Both verbose and compact coding styles where applicable

## For Students

These files demonstrate all the concepts you need to know for Exam 1. Read the code carefully, pay attention to the comments, and try running each file to see how it works.

Refer to `exam1_study_guide.md` in the parent folder for detailed explanations of each concept.
